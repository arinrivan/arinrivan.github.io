    <p>
        We live in a time where loudness is often mistaken for truth.
        The more something repeats, the more real it feels. The more it flashes,
        pings, and vibrates, the more our nervous system learns to treat it as important.
    </p>

    <p>
        But meaning rarely shouts. It arrives disguised as a pause — the moment
        you close a tab instead of opening another, the instant you notice the
        weight of your own breathing, the quiet discomfort when a notification
        pulls you away from a thought you actually wanted to keep.
    </p>

    <p>
        Stillness is not the absence of activity. It is the decision not to be
        dragged by every external rhythm. In that decision, a different kind of
        signal appears. One that does not care about being seen, liked or shared.
    </p>

    <p>
        This space exists for those signals. Not to fix the world, but to notice it
        more honestly. If you have found your way here, I hope you read slowly.
